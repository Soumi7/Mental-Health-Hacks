# Speak Up - Mental Health Hacks 2021

Check out our application <a href="https://mentalhealthweb.herokuapp.com/">here</a>


## Inspiration

 Humiliation is one of the primary reasons why men and women do not come forward to report their mental health issues.

People frequently find themselves living in denial and minimizing what they have gone through.
Men and women are oppressed. They don't speak openly about their personal problems. There are so many individuals who have faced oppression and issues in their life. A lot of them need help with mental issues. Some are going to a tough time. Some need a friend to talk to.

Many people have bravely overcome their problems.

## How we built it

We have used react for the front end and node.js for the backend. We used heroku to deploy our website.

## Challenges we ran into

We hosted a react app for the first time with Heroku! We ran into some issues in the beginning while getting everything to work.Mental health of people is something that need to be talked about more openly.
People who have suffered from it must be given an opportunity to come out with their story so that the next generation of people can safely tackle it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Hosted the application so that people across the world have a space to speak up about their mental issues. Got it to work!
